# Feelgorithm-Facial-based-emotion-analyzer
I've created EmotionMirror, a webcam-based app that tracks user mood during browsing sessions and recommends personalized wellness breaks based on facial expressions.

The app features:

1.Real-time facial expression analysis using face-api.js
2.Emotion detection for happy, sad, angry, neutral, and surprised states
3.Personalized wellness recommendations based on detected mood
4.Clean, modern UI with responsive design
5.Mood history tracking
6.Privacy-focused (all processing happens locally)
7.The application uses the webcam to analyze your facial expressions and suggest appropriate wellness breaks when it detects signs of stress, sadness, or other emotional states.
